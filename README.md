`Ping Dashboard` is a light explorer for Cosmos-based Blockchains.  https://ping.pub .

## What sets Ping Dashboard apart from other explorers?
**Ping Dashboard** stands out by providing a real-time exploration of blockchain data without relying on caching or pre-processing. It exclusively fetches data from the Cosmos full node via LCD/RPC endpoints, ensuring a truly authentic experience. This approach is referred to as the "Light Explorer."
